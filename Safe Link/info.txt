Purpose:
This bot checks if external links in reddit comments are safe according to the Google Safe Browsing API.

The bot will scan reddit comments for external links, then send a POST request with the target URL in the body of the
request to "https://safebrowsing.googleapis.com/v4/threatMatches:find." The bot then checks the body of the response to determine 
whether or not the link is safe.

In addition to filling out the clientUsername, clientPassword, clientID, and clientSecret variables, you will also need to generate
an API key to use the Google Safe Browsing API.

To prevent spam, this bot is triggered with the keyword "!checkLink ", but can be removed if desired.
