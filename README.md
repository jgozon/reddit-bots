# reddit-bots
This repository consists of the source code for the small reddit bots that I created. Anyone is free to use these bots as they wish.

## How can I use these bots?
Currently, these bots only work on r/testingground4bots. You will need to add all of the subreddits that you want the bot to respond in
by manually adding the desired subreddits to the subreddit list in the source code. You will also need to manually fill out the
clientUsername, clientPassword, clientID, and clientSecret variables which can be created with a reddit account. Finally, you will need to
install PRAW, the Python Reddit API Wrapper.
